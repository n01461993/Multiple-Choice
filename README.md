Javascript Multiple Choice quiz

This project uses a lot of functions to display the multiple choice quiz about Humber College. There are many steps to consider when having to display an variety of questions, with an array of answers to choose from.

Many of the challenges faced from putting this together is getting each function to work with each other. To perform a certain action may need multiple functions that are each calling upon each other, and getting them to work was very difficult. It can be hard to get something you want to happen when coding in Javascript, and syntax is very crucial to having code run smoothly.

Having a function for showing the question, showing the answer, having the buttons choose an option, buttons holding data on whether they are right or wrong, displaying the correct or incorrect answer, and showing the next question took some time to fully understand.

This was a very challenging task.
